# Admin Access Control Implementation

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Navbar Component
- Modified `src/components/Navbar.tsx` to conditionally render the admin button
- Added user metadata check using `useUser()` hook
- Admin button now only appears if `user?.publicMetadata?.role === "admin"`

### ✅ Admin Page Access Control
- Modified `src/app/admin/page.tsx` to check user role on server side
- Added redirect logic using `currentUser()` and `redirect()` from Next.js
- Non-admin users are redirected to home page ("/")

## Implementation Details

1. **Client-side check (Navbar):** Uses Clerk's `useUser()` hook to access user metadata and conditionally render the admin link
2. **Server-side check (Admin page):** Uses Clerk's `currentUser()` to check role on the server before rendering the page
3. **Redirect logic:** Non-admin users attempting to access `/admin` are redirected to the home page

## Testing Required
- [ ] Test with admin account (metadata.role = "admin") - should see admin button and access admin page
- [ ] Test with regular user account - should NOT see admin button and should be redirected from admin page
- [ ] Test when not signed in - should NOT see admin button

## Files Modified
- `src/components/Navbar.tsx`
- `src/app/admin/page.tsx`

## Notes
- Admin status is determined by Clerk user metadata: `publicMetadata.role === "admin"`
- The middleware currently doesn't protect the admin route, but the page-level redirect provides sufficient protection
